# AutoSort

### The problem

As students, we noticed a growing problem in our university cafeteria. People would often have trouble with recycling and picking the right bin to throw their trash into. Nowadays those bins aren't available to us, we have to leave all of the trash in one general bin which then gets sorted by other workers. 

### The solution

AutoSort! A bin that can automate the process of sorting rubbish for you. It does so by utilizing:
1. A barcode scanner
2. Machine vision


### The setup

We're using a RaspberryPi to run our scripts. That part is located in our 3d-printed bin. (write more details here)
